NNs need normalized inputs, so we first apply some preprocessing steps to these data. First, the mean and standard deviation of the inputs are computed over the training data set. Then, the humidity and temperature are normalized by subtracting the mean for each vertical level and dividing by the vertical average of their respective standard deviations, which are denoted by 𝜎q and 𝜎T . Because the LHF, SHF, and SOLIN are scalar, their normalization does not require vertical averaging. These normalized sL and qT profiles are then concatenated together to form a 2nz dimensional vector for each time point tn and coarse-grained grid cell (xi, yi); we call this vector xni . Similarly, let gi(t) be the negative of the vertically concatenated profiles of the advection terms in (1) and (2) and yi = [SHFn i , LHFni , SOLINn i ].
